# In a call

Create a page similar to the example image:

![example](in-a-call-example.png)

The layout is more suitable for mobile, so you can use a container with smaller width and then center it on screen.

* [] the red button is positioned on top of the image
* [] the red button is semi transparent so you can see the image below through the button
* [] the other person's image is positioned in the top right corner, but not exactly at the edge
* [] the other person's image has a border
* [] the other person's image has shadow effect
